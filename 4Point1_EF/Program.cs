             Write a program that will:
                Take in a first name from the user
                Case insensitive
                Trimmed
                Then print the full name of that user from the database
                If the name is not in the database then output “Name not found.” and exit.

            Challenges:
                If the name is not in the database, keep prompting until they enter a name that is, or until they enter “quit” (case insensitive).
                Also print the person’s phone number(s) based on their first name.
